<p style="font-style: italic">It was nearing sunset when I first sighted land around the point, the low sun blazing a golden light across the land before me. O, what a land it was! - all raised up in rolling mountains, the lush green of the forest accentuated by the stark white of the beach and the deep blue of the crisp, clear ocean. I knew at once that I had found something magical.<p>

<p> The Republic of Yawirra is a nation of 33 million inhabitants situated in Oceania, bordered on all sides by ocean. The majority of its inhabitants are French or Indigenous, and speak the two national languages: French and Ngujari, a language of the pre-settlement peoples of the country. The natural landscape is beautiful, highly fertile, and plentiful in natural resources. Yawirra plays a vital role on the regional and global stage, sitting on the United Nations Security Council and chairing the powerful YAPSEA coalition, and is one of the most advanced economies in the world.</p>
