Yesterday's constitutional referendum has delivered a resounding rebuke to
Charles De Gaulle and his French Fifth Republic, with 67% of the Federation
voting against the new constitution and sending a message that the time for
independence has come! The leader's ultimatum, to approve his
constitution or lose the protection of France entirely, has been a failure - the people of the Federation have declared that they no longer need the stewardship of the mother country and are ready to forge a brave new stage in the nation's future.
