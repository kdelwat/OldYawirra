title: Massacre of Wiranumba
---

In the wake of a series of escalating protests by British miners against what
they called discrimination in mining license regulations, a group of miners in
Wiranumba, Monhoudou, decided to force the French authorities into action. The
leader of the group of 40 men, John Robertson, had gained prestige in the
protest movement for his scathing oratory attacks on the colonial authorities,
and together with two confidants he drafted the *Wiranumba Manifesto*, which
declared the following:

> We, the miners of the BRITISH EMPIRE, are tired of the endless discrimination
of the FRENCH colonial authorities, who have made it their prerogative to ensure
that no British man may MAKE A LIVING in the mining business. We ask them - are
we not FELLOW MEN? Are we not working next to each other in the same brave new
land, in the same dust and dirt, seeking the same riches?
>
> The tired excuses of the authorities will no longer appease us. Only real and
> concrete ACTION can do anything to halt the banner of anger under which we now
> rally. We demand the following, at the earliest opportunity, with the least
>delay, and with the concerted effort of the colonial authorities:
>
> + the ABOLITION of all mining license classes specifically tied to the British
nationality of the licensee...
> + the IMMEDIATE RELEASE of all British citizens who have been incarcerated for
rebelling against the oppressive French administration.
> + the FULL EQUALISATION of conditions and taxation between British and French
miners on the Australian goldfields.
> + the GUARANTEE OF INDEMNITY for all those who join us in protesting against
these unfair and unjust conditions.
>
> Return to us our liberty! Return to use our dignity!

On the morning of the 2nd of February, 1834, the miners published the Manifesto
in the *Miner's Herald*, the region's British newspaper, and posted it at the
offices of authorities in surrounding towns. Shortly before 9AM, the group burst
into the Wiranumba Provincial Administration Office, weapons drawn, and ordered
all staff to leave the building, with the exception of the Provincial
Adminstrator Jacques Edmonteau and his assistant, Land Manager Gupirra Nalu. The
staff complied unanimously, while the two hostages were locked in Edmonteau's
office and provided with food and water. On the flagpole outside, the Miner's
Jack, a flag symbolising the protest movement, was raised, replacing the French
flag.
