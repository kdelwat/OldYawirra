Worker's Alliance Party holds government while the Agrarian Party and Green
Party hold opposition.

# Government

## Socialist-Democratic Party

With a predominantly urban voting base, the moderate left party supports
increased funding to public services and social welfare. Their economic policy
revolves around increased taxation of high-income earners and income
redistribution programs, with some support for free-trade. The party supports
intervention in Syria and Iraq against IS and no change to immigration levels.

## Worker's Alliance Party

The party sits more to the centre than the Socialist-Democratic Party, focusing
on a base of unionists and industrial workers and appealing to populist ideals,
particularly worker's rights. Economically, they pursue a protectionist agenda.
Their main point of difference with the Socialist-Democratic Party is their
staunch anti-war stance, and they strongly oppose military intervention against
IS.
